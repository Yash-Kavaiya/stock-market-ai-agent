    D --> E[Configure Environment]
```

### Step 1: Add Gunicorn to requirements.txt

Ensure `gunicorn` is in your requirements.txt file for production deployment:

```bash
echo "gunicorn==21.2.0" >> requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Build and Test Docker Container Locally

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t stock-market-ai-agent .

# Run the container locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env stock-market-ai-agent
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 to test your application.

### Step 3: Deploy to Google Cloud Run

```bash
# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login

# Configure Docker to use Google Container Registry
gcloud auth configure-docker

# Set your Google Cloud project ID
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Build and push the Docker image
docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/stock-market-ai-agent .
docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/stock-market-ai-agent

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy stock-market-ai-agent \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/stock-market-ai-agent \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars="ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key,NEWS_API_KEY=your_key,SECRET_KEY=your_secret"
```
